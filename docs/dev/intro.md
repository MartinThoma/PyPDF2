# Developer Intro

PyPDF2 is a library and hence its users are developers. This document is not for
the users, but for people who want to work on PyPDF2 itself.

## Installing Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

## Benchmarks

We need to keep an eye on performance and thus we have a few benchmarks.

See [py-pdf.github.io/PyPDF2/dev/bench](https://py-pdf.github.io/PyPDF2/dev/bench/)
